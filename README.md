# Graphical-Vector-Equation-Plotter-Web
 An online program using pyscript and matplotlib to plot graphical vector equations
 
Hopefully it is usefull, if there are changes I can make to improve it then please tell me.

Originates from this code `https://github.com/z-dodson/Graphical-Vector-Equation-Plotter/`

Uses pyscript to run the python code in the web browser

Also used PHP as a server side processing language

## To use
It's quite self explanatory, you have to enter the vectors in a ceratin way (based on A-Level Further Maths), see the help button in the GUI.
